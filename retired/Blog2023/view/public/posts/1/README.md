How this website came to be

As I'm learning and exploring new skills, I've found that some projects help me learn core concepts better than others. I'm planning on filling up this website with helpful tips & starter kits for the projects that helped me learn the most

If you find yourself particurly interested in one of my posts, or have some suggestions for me to explore, please feel free to send me a message @ bb5369@g.rit.edu
