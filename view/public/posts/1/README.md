How this website came to be

As I'm learning and exploring new skills, I've found that some projects help you learn core concepts better than others. 

And for fun I'm planning on filling up this website with helpful tips & starter kits 

If you find yourself particurly interested one my posts, or have some suggestions for me to explore, please feel free to send me a message @ bb5369@g.rit.edu
