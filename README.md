# Blog
Blog form of my projects with a cool UI

### Flow for how I update the blog
I use #tag to add tags, these tags can be setup with cool css presets in the view. Use the full path in links to images. To add or update a blog simply:  
1. Add a markdown file to the blogs folder
2. Run build
3. Push to repo
