How this website came to be

I made this website to store some of the cool stuff I run into in a format that I thought might be cool to expiriment with  

As I'm learning and exploring new skills, I've found that some projects help you learn the core concepts better than others.

The ones I find particulalrly helpful, and fun I plan to write a post about and maybe sell a kit to get started. 

If you find yourself particurly interested one my posts, or have some suggestions for me to explore, please feel free to send me a message @ bb5369@g.rit.edu
