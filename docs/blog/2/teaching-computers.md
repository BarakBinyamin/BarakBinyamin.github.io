Does order matter when learning? Absolutely. The order of subjects gives us context and perspective which carry far too much weight throughout our entire exploration of various fields. I have studied computer engineering and mathematics for the past 6 years, and I can say that many lessons obfuscated key concepts, and made it difficult to grasp the essentials of each subject. My biggest qualms in the introductions to coding are with puzzle coding with Scratch, Java, or the choice of an integrated development environment (IDE's).

If you've never coded before, you've likely heard of the first two. The last, IDE's, are apps that you can write code in that give spelling suggestions for syntax and have buttons to "Run" and "Debug" code. The problem is that all of these spaces are actually difficult for even experienced programmers to produce anything useful with. And though these products claim to be teaching the basic concepts by removing the complexities, they're really adding complexity and creating spaces to gain skills that while transferable, are pretty irrelevant. That can be pretty demoralizing.  

That's why I think the best place to start is on the command line with python, or in the browser with html. Python is an app that you can download and interact with in text rather than with buttons. You can type commands directly or give it a file to a list of commands called a script. There are online communities that have developed a libraries of scripts that can be combined to perform greater functions, many of which are data processing related, like doing statistics or generating graphs from datasets. 
```python
# numpy 
# pandas 
# show the average of a dataset from excel file
# make a graph of peoples preference for ice cream over the past 10 years
```

The browser is another great place to start. You can write an html file in a simple text editor on your computer and open it up in a browser to make a useful interactive dashboard. 
```html
// html of dashboard
```

Arguably one of the most important parts about coding is community. There are continuously growing online databases, chat forums, and groups that are competing to make the best libraries and tools to share for free with the world. Knowing where to look and how to take advantage of these tools is really what most of us software engineers are doing these days, definitely not making everything from scratch (no pun intended!)

Learn about new libraries and tools on github, some coding channels (be careful not to just watch) like firebase, npm for javascript which is part of html and pip for python. There are many more communities for both but those are great places to start!
